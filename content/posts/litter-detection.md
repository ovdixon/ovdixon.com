#### Background
Huge amounts of litter wash up along coastlines around the world. Not only is this problem an ugly eyesore, it poses a devastating environmental impact to wildlife, water quality and human health. Currently the most commonly used method for monitoring the litter that washes onto coastlines is boots on the ground visual counting, often involving large teams of peoples. However if we consider the sheer size and accessibility of coastal areas in Australia alone this is overwhelmingly inefficient.

I sought to explore the feasibility of training a simple machine learning model for object detection of beach litter. A forewarning that this is one of my first ventures into the world of ML so it was very much a learning process for myself included.


#### Gathering Training Data

I collated a set of 40 images of collected coastal litter. Initially, I planned on gathering a much larger dataset. However not only was my laptop underpowered to train a large volume of images without turning into an expensive lap warmer but I also hoped that a small dataset of higher quality images would produce a higher quality model. All images were hand-picked from Google Images


#### Labeling Images
