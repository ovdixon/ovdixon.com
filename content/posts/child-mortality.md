This piece of data journalism was written for an Information Visualisation Design Studio I took at university. We were given a historical [dataset](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Child%20mortality%2C%201950-2017%20(IHME%2C%202017)) on child mortality around the world. The story I sought to tell was how the lives of children living in Sub-Saharan Africa are being disproportionately endangered by electricity poverty.
