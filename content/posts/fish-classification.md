Fishing has always been a hobby of mine. To ensure the sustainiblity of recreational fish stocks it is important that fisherman are able to recognise different fish species and recall size restrictions / bag limits. I thought this application could help new anglers identify the fish they catch.


#### Collecting Images

I decided to train a model able to recognise five of the most common recreational fish species caught along the East Coast of Australia; bream, whiting, flathead, luderick and whiting. 

{{< figure src="species.png" caption="Three of the five species">}}

Using the command line tool Instaloader I scraped images from public instagram hashtags under each species (i.e #sandwhiting)  I scraped 1000+ images for each species, then went through and filtered out the best images totalling a minimum of 250.

#### Training on CreateML
This is Apple's no-code computer vision training tool optimised for use with iOS. You simply drag and drop a collection of class folders to begin training. My training data totalled 1,288 over 5 classes.

#### Testing
I tested the model on 10 unseen images across the 5 species classes. Results were suprising, 10/10 accurate classifications.

#### Deployment
I deployed the model to my iPhone 12 Pro using a public project called [MLModelCamera](https://github.com/shu223/MLModelCamera). It allows for Drag-and-Drop testing of Core ML models.
