I wrote this story as part of an Information Visualisation Design Studio I took at university. For the assignment I was given an [archive](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Child%20mortality%2C%201950-2017%20(IHME%2C%202017)) of all tweets from President Trump during his time in office. The story that I sought to tell was how the Twitter habits of Donald Trump are influenced by his love of golf. 

Scroll through the story below. You can also check out the static site code [here](https://replit.com/@ovdixon/TrumpTweetsGolf#index.html). <br><br>
