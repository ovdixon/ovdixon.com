#### Inspiration


{{< figure src="echo.jpg" caption="Christophe Vorlet @nytimes">}}

This was a group project completed as part of an Interactive Product Design Studio. The focus area was Tackling COVID-19 Misinformation through Design. Rather than trying to censor misinformation  we reframed the brief; how could we improve the capacity of communities to cope with the socio-emotional impacts of such information.


#### Ideation

Below is a (very) high-level summary of our design process:

1. Ideated several concepts
2. Collected user feedback
3. Iterated and refined to a single concept
4. Usability testing
5. High-fidelity prototype


The chosen concept was a *community-based platform that facilitates users in sharing strategies to cope with the impacts of COVID-19 misinformation and mandated lockdowns*.

#### Implementation

The web application was developed as a mobile-first static website. It is more a proof of concept with the opportunity to develop the greater functionality in the future.
