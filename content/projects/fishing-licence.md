#### Inspiration

The current process of purchasing a recreational fishing licence online in NSW violates several principles of visual, navigation, and interaction design. 


#### Ideation
I sought to develop an alternative web-based (mobile & desktop) onboarding process for purchasing a fishing licence. I began with some user profiles to understand who would be using the site. Fishing attracts a diverse range of people of all ages. It is important that the licence onboarding be an accessible lightweight experience focused on efficiency.

#### Implementation
 It was developed from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JS  Several features, including a progress bar and sticky navigation, were designed to give the user a greater sense of control.  
 I received the following feedback from the marker: "You scoped this project excellently!  Good use of code, only minor mistakes and consistent styling and use of javascript. The website itself was excellently done."
