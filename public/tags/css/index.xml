&lt;p>The current process of purchasing a recreational fishing licence online in NSW violates several principles of visual, navigation, and interaction design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ideation">Ideation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I sought to develop an alternative web-based (mobile &amp;amp; desktop) onboarding process for purchasing a fishing licence. I began with some user profiles to understand who would be using the site. Fishing attracts a diverse range of people of all ages. It is important that the licence onboarding be an accessible lightweight experience focused on efficiency.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was developed from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JS Several features, including a progress bar and sticky navigation, were designed to give the user a greater sense of control.&lt;br>
I received the following feedback from the marker: &amp;ldquo;You scoped this project excellently! Good use of code, only minor mistakes and consistent styling and use of javascript. The website itself was excellently done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
