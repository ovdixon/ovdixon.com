To ensure the sustainiblity of recreational fish stocks it is important that fisherman are able to recognise different fish species and recall size restrictions / bag limits. I thought this application could help new anglers identify the fish they catch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="collecting-images">Collecting Images&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I decided to train a model able to recognise five of the most common recreational fish species caught along the East Coast of Australia; bream, whiting, flathead, luderick and whiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Using the command line tool Instaloader I scraped images from public instagram hashtags under each species (i.e #sandwhiting) I scraped 1000+ images for each species, then went through and filtered out the best images totalling a minimum of 250.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is Apple&amp;rsquo;s no-code computer vision training tool optimised for use with iOS. You simply drag and drop a collection of class folders to begin training. My training data totalled 1,288 over 5 classes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="testing">Testing&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I tested the model on 10 unseen images across the 5 species classes. Results were suprising, 10/10 accurate classifications.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="deployment">Deployment&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I deployed the model to my iPhone 12 Pro using a public project called &lt;a href="https://github.com/shu223/MLModelCamera">MLModelCamera&lt;/a>. It allows for Drag-and-Drop testing of Core ML models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The current process of purchasing a recreational fishing licence online in NSW violates several principles of visual, navigation, and interaction design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ideation">Ideation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I sought to develop an alternative web-based (mobile &amp;amp; desktop) onboarding process for purchasing a fishing licence. I began with some user profiles to understand who would be using the site. Fishing attracts a diverse range of people of all ages. It is important that the licence onboarding be an accessible lightweight experience focused on efficiency.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="implementation">Implementation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It was developed from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JS Several features, including a progress bar and sticky navigation, were designed to give the user a greater sense of control.&lt;br>
I received the following feedback from the marker: &amp;ldquo;You scoped this project excellently! Good use of code, only minor mistakes and consistent styling and use of javascript. The website itself was excellently done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
