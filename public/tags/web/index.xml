      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this story as part of an Information Visualisation Design Studio I took at university. For the assignment I was given an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Child%20mortality%2C%201950-2017%20(IHME%2C%202017)&#34;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of all tweets from President Trump during his time in office. The story that I sought to tell was how the Twitter habits of Donald Trump are influenced by his love of golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll through the story below. You can also check out the static site code &lt;a href=&#34;https://replit.com/@ovdixon/TrumpTweetsGolf#index.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a web prototype I developed for an Advanced Web Design course. The brief was to design a web application to help people manage their study sessions. I narrowed it down further to focus on people learning the Indonesian language (Bahasa). The app does not include any Indonesian language content, as this was outside the brief. Rather it helps people maximise their language study productivity through various features like Pomodoro timers and editable flash cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather bare bones in terms of design but it was developed from scratch (template free) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is also presented as a single page app meaning the app is dynamically updated based on user interaction without a page refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have play around with the app below. You can also check out the app code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ovdixon/bahasa-bud&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This piece of data journalism was written for an Information Visualisation Design Studio I took at university. I was given a historical &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Child%20mortality%2C%201950-2017%20(IHME%2C%202017)&#34;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; on child mortality around the world. The story I sought to tell was how the lives of children living in Sub-Saharan Africa are being disproportionately endangered by electricity poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
